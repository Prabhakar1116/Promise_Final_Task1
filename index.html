        <!-- Definition of meme in a paragraph -->
        <h2>What is a meme?</h2>
        <p>The term "meme" was coined by British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book "The Selfish
            Gene." Dawkins defined a meme as a unit of cultural information that spreads from person to person, similar
            to the way genes spread through biological evolution.The origin of memes can be traced back to the broader concept of cultural transmission and evolution, but internet memes as a distinct phenomenon have their roots in the digital age and the interconnected nature of online communities.</p>
